## Prerequisites
- **Linux/MacOS x86_64**: The Skills Network Lab environment provides this.
- **Caikit (v0.9.2)**: We will install this.
- **Python (v3.8+)**: The Skills Network Lab environment has Python 3.8 pre-installed.
- **pip (v23.0+)**: As the first task in the project, we will upgrade pip to the latest version.

## Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis application using the **Caikit** framework and **Hugging Face's** model serving capabilities. The goal is to perform text sentiment analysis by configuring the Caikit runtime and an AI model, followed by testing it through a client application.

## Procedure
Complete the following tasks to configure the Caikit runtime and the AI model, and then test them from a client application:
1. **Create the project**: Set up the necessary directories and files for your project.
2. **Create the data model specification**: Define the data format used by the Caikit module.
3. **Create the model wrapper**: Implement a wrapper that integrates the AI model with the Caikit framework.
4. **Include the module and package dependencies**: Specify any necessary dependencies in your project configuration.
5. **Start the Caikit runtime**: Launch the Caikit runtime to serve the model for inference.
6. **Test the sentiment analysis**: Run tests to validate the functionality of the sentiment analysis model through a client application.
