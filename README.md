## Overview 📚
This project implements a sentiment analysis application using the **Caikit** framework and **Hugging Face's** model serving capabilities. The goal is to perform text sentiment analysis by configuring the Caikit runtime and an AI model, followed by testing it through a client application.

## Procedure 🛠️
Complete the following tasks to configure the Caikit runtime and the AI model, and then test them from a client application:

   - Set up the necessary directories and files for your project.
   
2. **Create the Data Model Specification**: 
   - Define the data format used by the Caikit module.
   
3. **Create the Model Wrapper**: 
   - Implement a wrapper that integrates the AI model with the Caikit framework.
   
4. **Include the Module and Package Dependencies**: 
   - Specify any necessary dependencies in your project configuration.
   
5. **Start the Caikit Runtime**: 
   - Launch the Caikit runtime to serve the model for inference.
   
6. **Test the Sentiment Analysis**: 
   - Run tests to validate the functionality of the sentiment analysis model through a client application.

## Installation 🚀
